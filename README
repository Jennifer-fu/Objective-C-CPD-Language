# Objective-C CPD Language 

This jar can be used in conjunction with PMD/CPD to scan for copy and pasted code within
XCode projects.  To use this language definition, you need to add the jar to your
PMD/CPD classpath and provide a --language directive indicating that you are scanning
Objective-C code.  Here is a command line example:

java -Xmx512m -classpath pmd-4.2.5.jar:ObjCLanguage-0.0.8-SNAPSHOT.jar net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.CPD --minimum-tokens 100 --files [Path to XCode project classes] --language ObjectiveC --encoding UTF-8 --format net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.XMLRenderer
